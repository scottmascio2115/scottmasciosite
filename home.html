    <h4>Want to go fishing and dont know where to go or what bait to use?</h4><br>
    <p class='description'>
    Spot2Fish.com looks to solve those problems.<br>
    Using Geolocation the Twitter Api and the Instagram Api, Spot2Fish.com searches in a 60 mile radius of your location and returns Tweets and Instagrams related to fishing.<br>
    Thats cool if you want to find people who like to fish, but a user wants to know where to fish!<br>
    By filtering the results from the Twitter Api and Instagram Api to only return Tweets and Instagrams that contain geocoordinates we know the location people are posting from.<br>
    I use their location in coordination with the Google Maps Api to display their locaiton on a map.<br>
    <span ><a href='http://spot2fish.herokuapp.com/'><img id='spotpic' src="images/spot.jpeg" alt="spot2fish" height="500" width="500"></a></span><br>
    Currently the Spot2fish is in staging at <a href='http://spot2fish.herokuapp.com/'>http://spot2fish.herokuapp.com/</a><br>
    Spot2Fish is in staging because currently I am refactoring the javascript code to use the module pattern and I am implementing Handlebars.<br>
    <a href='https://twitter.com/spot2fish'>I am also building hype on Twitter : )</a><br><br>
    Feel free to visit and go fishing!!<br><br>

    <p class='description'>
    I kept a blog about my apprecticeship at <a href='http://myapprenticeshippatterns.herokuapp.com/'> Neo</a>, the blog is based on the book Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover.<br><br>
    The book Apprenticeship Patterns outlines values of a good apprentice and how to mold a successful apprenticeship.<br>
    Each week my goal was to outline 3 patterns from the book that related to my week as an apprentice.<br>
    I very much enjoyed my time as an apprentice. Not only did I increse my skills and contribute to the team, I also developed relationships that I hope to sustain well into the future.<br>
    Please contact <a href='https://www.neo.com/offices/columbus'>Neo</a> for references and reccomendations.<br>

    <p class='description'>
    jQuery plugin to add a reference section to page with a description of each of the selected elements. The description is also shown on the hover of element.<br>
    One of my assignments as an apprentice at Neo was to create a jQuery plugin, and register it with jQuery.<br>
    I decided on making a plugin that has the ability to add a reference section to a site or paper.<br>
    I outlined the steps I took to create the plugin <a href='http://myapprenticeshippatterns.herokuapp.com/#/jquery_plugin'> here</a>.<br>
    I really enjoyed this exercise, it was challenging and gave me a chance to dive head first into jQuery and Javascript, two things that Ive grown to love.<br>

        Currently I am an apprentice at Neo in Columbus,Oh.<br>
        My apprenticeship ends August 22nd but I can leave the apprenticeship and start working for you now.<br>
        Daily responsibilities as an apprentice are to both learn from my mentors, as well as contribute to client projects.<br>
        Neo is a Ruby on Rails shop that uses all the most up to date technologies. Besides using Ruby, Javascript and Rails, I got a chance to get my feet wet in Ember, learn MacVim and I even made a <a href='#/referencesection'> jQuery plugin</a>.<br>
        As an apprentice I learned in a lean enviroment that consisted of daily standups, pivitoal tracker, pull requests and retros.<br>
        I love my time as an apprentice. Neo is 100% pairing, and the time spent pairing and receiving one on one teaching from the Neo devolopers is invaluable.<br>
        My side project that I worked on while at Neo is Spot2fish.com (currently a work in progress <a href='#/spot2fish'>Spot2Fish</a>).<br>
        I have kept a blog during my experience as an <a href='#/apprentice'>apprentice</a>.<br>
        Prior to Neo I attended Dev BootCamp.<br><br>

        Dev BootCamp is a 9 week intensive program teaching Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Jquery and Git workflow.<br>
        The fist three weeks of Dev BootCamp focuses on Ruby and is an introduction to Git and Github.<br>
        Second three weeks of Dev BootCamp focuses on Sinatra, Active Record, Javascript, jQuery and Heroku.<br>
        Final three weeks of Dev BootCamp introduces Rails, Rspec and Jasime.<br>
        The finale is a group project that last the final ten days of Dev BootCamp. The cohort is divided into 4 teams of 4 memebers and our task is to create a website/app using any skills learned at Dev BootCamp.<br>
        My team members and I created Adopt-A-Coder, a crowd based scholarship funding program. A more thorough description can be found <a href='#/adoptacoder'> here</a>.<br>
        DevBoot Camp has a stellar reputation, and I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to get into coding. It changed my life.<br>
        Prior to Dev BootCamp I was a trader on the Chicago Board of Trade.<br><br>

         I worked for 7 years on the Chicago Board of Trade as a fixed income trader.<br>
         Starting as a clerk in the pits I moved my way up to senior trader.<br>
         I traded the spread between fixed income futures and the underlying cash price, known as the basis.<br>
         I cant say I hated trading or hate trading, I can say it wasnt for me.<br>
