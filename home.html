      Spot2fish allows you to vote on the best fishing related posts on social media. You can browse the top rated spots or recently created spots and vote for your favorite spot. Each spot is accompanied by Spot2fish location details and a clickable link to the social media profile of the fisherman or fisherwoman.
    </p>
    <p class='description spot2fish-description'>
      The Spot2fish location details outline the exact location the fisherman or fisherwoman uploaded their fishing related post to social media. The Spot2fish location details include both the latitude and longitude as well as the city and state. In most cases this is the same location where they caught their fish, allowing you to potentially steal their fishing spot. Click the globe icon to reveal the map displaying the potential fishing spot.

    <p class='description'>
     I kept a <a href='http://myapprenticeshippatterns.herokuapp.com/'> blog </a> about my apprenticeship at  Neo, the blog is based on the book Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover.<br><br>
     The book Apprenticeship Patterns outlines values of a good apprentice and how to mold a successful apprenticeship.<br><br>
     Each week my goal was to outline 3 patterns from the book that related to my week as an apprentice.<br><br>
     I very much enjoyed my time as an apprentice. Not only did I increase my skills and contribute to the team, I also developed relationships that I hope to sustain well into the future.<br><br>
     Please contact <a href='https://www.neo.com/offices/columbus'>Neo</a> for references and recommendations.<br><br>

    <p class='description'>
     jQuery plugin to add a reference section to page with a description of each of the selected elements. The description is also shown on the hover of element.<br><br>
     One of my assignments as an apprentice at Neo was to create a jQuery plugin, and register it with jQuery.<br><br>
     I decided on making a plugin that has the ability to add a reference section to a site or paper.<br><br>
     I outlined the steps I took to create the plugin <a href='http://myapprenticeshippatterns.herokuapp.com/#/jquery_plugin'> here</a>.<br><br>
     I really enjoyed this exercise, it was challenging and gave me a chance to dive head first into jQuery and Javascript, two things that Ive grown to love.<br><br>

        <p class='description'>
         Neo is a Ruby on Rails shop that uses all the most up to date technologies. Besides using Ruby, Javascript and Rails, I got a chance to get my feet wet in Ember, learn MacVim and I even made a <a href='#/referencesection'> jQuery plugin</a>.<br><br>
         As an apprentice I learned in a lean environment that consisted of daily stand ups, Pivotal tracker, pull requests and retros.<br><br>
         I love my time as an apprentice. Neo is 100% pairing, and the time spent pairing and receiving one on one teaching from the Neo developers is invaluable.<br><br>
         I have kept a <a href='#/apprentice'> blog </a>during my experience as an apprentice.<br><br>

         Dev BootCamp is a 9 week intensive program teaching Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Jquery and Git workflow.<br><br>
         The fist three weeks of Dev BootCamp focuses on Ruby and is an introduction to Git and Github.<br><br>
         Second three weeks of Dev BootCamp focuses on Sinatra, Active Record, Javascript, jQuery and Heroku.<br><br>
         Final three weeks of Dev BootCamp introduces Rails, Rspec and Jasime.<br><br>
         The finale is a group project that last the final ten days of Dev BootCamp. The cohort is divided into 4 teams of 4 members and our task is to create a website/app using any skills learned at Dev BootCamp.<br><br>
         My team members and I created Adopt-A-Coder, a crowd based scholarship funding program.<br><br>
         Dev Bootcamp has a stellar reputation, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into coding. It changed my life.<br><br>
         Prior to Dev BootCamp I was a trader on the Chicago Board of Trade.<br><br><br>
